# This repository contains different algorithms using the fastf1 python package
### More algorithms will continue to be added
### Current algorithms

- `f1_1.py` – `f1_4.py` → utilise FastF1 for analysis of races
- `pred.py` – `pred2.py` → prediction models for F1 races
- `f1.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for the prediction model
- `f1_1.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with Speed Map of Driver
- `f1_2.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with Performance Analysis of Podium Drivers for Race
