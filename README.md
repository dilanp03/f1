# This repository contains different algorithms using the fastf1 python package
# More algorithms will continue to be added
# Current algorithms:
#       f1_1.py - f1_4.py -> utilise fastf1 for analysis of races
#       pred.py - pred2.py -> prediction models for f1 races
#       f1.ipynb -> jupyter notebook for the prediction model
